# Digital-Platform-for-Social-Welfare-Services-Management-in-Sri-Lanka
Research project of group 25-26J-320

Specialization: Information Technology (IT).
Supervisor: Senior Lecturer Anjalie Gamage.

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to address systemic inefficiencies in Sri Lanka's current social welfare ecosystem, which currently relies on manual application handling and fragmented data. This centralized, AI-powered digital platform is designed for citizens, Divisional Secretariat officers, and policymakers to enhance transparency and accessibility.
The system utilizes predictive analytics and machine learning to ensure that aid reaches genuinely deserving citizens while providing proactive, data-driven decision-making tools for the government.

## 2. Architectural Diagram
The system is built on a multi-layered infrastructure consisting of a User Interface Layer for citizens and officers, an AI Intelligence Layer for processing, and an Infrastructure Layer for secure data storage.
